With its calm, glassy waters and picture-perfect mountain backdrop, it's the ideal spot to kick back, paddle out, and soak up the sunshine.

2. Paul Lake
Just 25 minutes from Kamloops, Paul Lake is a clean, scenic haven that’s become a go-to summer spot for locals and visitors alike. Tucked within a peaceful Provincial Park, it offers everything you need for a perfect paddle day—campgrounds, a spacious day-use area, and a convenient boat launch with plenty of parking. Families love to set up camp early, cast a line, and spend the afternoon floating across the calm waters.

Whether you're planning a family outing or a quiet solo cruise, Paul Lake brings that sweet mix of adventure and relaxation.


3. Monte Lake
Monte Lake is a hidden gem nestled between Kamloops and Vernon, offering the perfect spot for a peaceful day on the water. Whether you're a local or visiting, it’s a place where the stress of everyday life just melts away. The warm waters in summer make it the perfect place to cool off, and you won’t find the crowds of more popular spots—just you, the lake, and the stunning scenery! It’s the kind of place where you can float along and let your worries drift away with the current. Locals often say it’s the best-kept secret in the area, and we couldn’t agree more. So, grab your paddle, hop in an inflatable boat, and experience the tranquility of Monte Lake for yourself!
4. Shuswap Lake (bit farther but worth it)
Shuswap Lake is just a short 45–60-minute drive from Kamloops, but once you arrive, you’ll quickly realize it’s totally worth the drive! With its massive, winding waters and endless coves, this lake is perfect for full-day adventures or group rentals—whether you're cruising the shoreline, splashing around, or just soaking in the breathtaking views. As the locals say, “If you can’t find the perfect spot on Shuswap, you’re not looking hard enough!” So, rally your friends or family, rent our inflatable boat, and dive into all the fun and freedom this incredible lake has to offer.

Kamloops Lake is the closest large lake to the city, and it's the perfect spot for a relaxing day out on the water! This expansive, open lake offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and rolling hills, making it an ideal place to unwind—especially on those calm, sunny days. The smooth waters are perfect for a peaceful paddle or a leisurely ride, but the lake is big enough to explore at your own pace. And if you’re into fishing, you’re in for a treat! Local anglers swear by the lake’s abundant trout population, and there’s a fun little tradition: every year, the locals gather for an impromptu “Kamloops Lake Fishing Challenge.” The winner? Bragging rights, of course, and maybe a fresh catch for dinner. As the saying goes around here, “When the weather’s calm, there’s no better place to be than Kamloops Lake!” Whether you’re fishing, hiking nearby trails, or just taking in the views, this lake offers something for everyone.

Whether you're out for a quiet paddle or simply soaking up the tranquility, Lac Le Jeune is all about slowing down and enjoying the moment. Locals often joke that it’s the "best-kept secret for a peaceful escape," and we couldn’t agree more! It’s the kind of place where you can paddle at your own pace, let the world slip away, and maybe even spot a deer or two along the shore. So pack a picnic, grab a boat, and spend a peaceful afternoon at Lac Le Jeune—it’s the ultimate spot to recharge and unwind.
